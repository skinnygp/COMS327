* Using C and C++ in the same program.
  C++ uses name mangling; C doesn't.  Name mangling is necessary in order to
  allow function overloading.  Mangled names encode the formal parameters so
  that the compiler can choose the right function based on the arguments.
  In order for C++ to make calls to C functions or vice versa, it's necessary
  to tell the C++ compiler not to mangle the names.  We'll need this with any
  functions that we wish to call in both C and C++.  When compiling with a
  C++ compiler, you tell the compiler to use a C calling convention (no name
  mangling) by declaring the function 'extern "C"', or by putting the
  declaration inside an 'extern "C"' block.  Usually this is done with the
  following construction:

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    exterrn "C" {
    #endif

    /* Prototypes of functions that you want to use in C and C++ */

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif

  C doesn't know anything about 'extern "C"', so the guards around this block
  ensure that when you include this header in C code, that extra stuff is
  stripped out by the preprocessor, but when used in C++ code, it remains.
* String class example
  In which we develop a string class, string229.

* Overloading
  Functions
    Functions can have the same name, as long as they have different
    formal parameters.  Compiler figures out which one to call based on
    actual parameters
  Operators
    Operators are overloaded by defining special "operator<operator>()"
    functions, where <operator> is the actual operator, for instance,
    overload the addition operator by defining operator+().
* Classes
  public
    Anybody can see this field
  private
    Only members of this class can see it
  protected
    Only this class and subclasses can see it
  friend
    Your friends have full access to your privates.
