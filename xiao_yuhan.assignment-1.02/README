Project Description: Add functions to save dungeon on the disk and read dungeon from disk.
Note:
* Used Jeremy's code from Assignment-1.01.
* After make, there is a TAGS file and after run ./rlg327, there are three pgm files will be created. Those are all from Jeremy's code, not mine.
* Places that are written by me: Function load(dungeon_t *d), Function save(dungeon_t *d), typedef enum action and main().
* The data file will be saved to HOME/.rlg327/dungeon once used --save switch.
* If there is no HOME/.rlg327 directory, --save will print error for opening this file.
* The dungeon data will be read from HOME/.rlg327/dungeon once used --load switch.
* If there is no HOME/.rlg327/dungeon, --load will print error for opening this file.
* My code can only tell if the file is in right version but it cannot tell if it is the right semantic(But that doesn't matter I guess).
* --load and --save work well. Cannot use two same actions. You can type --load --save to load the file, display it and edit it over and over again.
* All tests passed except those oversize ones: adventure.rlg327, goodwork.rlg327 and hello.rlg327

Relevant Functions:
[Line: 706] load(dungeon_t *d): Load dungeon data from the target file.
[Line: 805] save(dungeon_t *d): Save dungeon data to the target file. 

Data Structures:
[Line: 862] typedef enum action{
  		action_general,
  		action_save,
  		action_load,
	    }action_t;
