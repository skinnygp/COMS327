Project Description: “Fog of War” and interfacing C with C++
Note:
* Big Note: Since there are bugs in npc_next_pos, test it with ONLY ONE monster is better! (./rlg327 -n 1)!!!!!!!!!!!1
            too many monsters may cause game stuck which is super annoying.
            In case you do not want to do that, I have changed the MAX_MONSTERS to 5.
* Fog of war: PC can see 5*5 even it's in ter_floor_hall.
* Segmentation fault may occur.
* First line shows PC's position.
* 23rd line shows modes(control/look).
* 24th line shows wrong move when move cannot be done.
* When unbound keys are pressed, do nothing and wait a correct key.
* Portion changes when distance between boundaries and pc is less than 4.
* In look mode, move 3 units every time when moving view. Cannot go out bounds.
* When going up/down stairs, go to the stairs' position and press >/<.
