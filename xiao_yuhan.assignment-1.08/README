Project Description: 1. Rename your C files to C++ files
                     2. Parsing Monster Definitions
Note:
* I added return 0 after parsing so it will not generate the dungeon after print monster definitions.
* There is no function to parse object_desc.txt.
* The order of the parse information depends on the order in monster_desc.txt. (No specific order)
* Shows file cannot open if there is no monster_desc.txt in /.rlg327
* Shows metadata is not correct if the first line is not RLG327 MONSTER DESCRIPTION 1
* All used code is in rlg327.cpp

Relevant Functions:
int parse(void) in
All functions c to cpp
