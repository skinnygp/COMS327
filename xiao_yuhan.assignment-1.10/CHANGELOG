Day One   (Apr 11, 2017): Found and Fixed bug: For function wear_object, the input cannot be an object pointer
                          because we want to replace the object in bag with object in equipment (and it won't change).
                          So the way to fix this is change the input from an object pointer to a index in the bag.

Day Two   (Apr 12, 2017): Found and Fixed bug: memory leak when user pick up an object and quit the game.
