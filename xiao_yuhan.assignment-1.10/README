CHANGELOG

Project Description: Choose Your Own Assignment
Note:
* At the beginning of the game, asks for player's name and shows welcome.
* In game, shows PC's rank, EXP/EXP needed to rank up, HP and speed at the information line(bottom).

* New terrain_type_t:
* called portal, shown as '$'.
* When standing on a portal and enter '$', moves PC to a random portal position.

* New combat mode:
* When PC meet a monster, enters the new combat mode.
* Shows Monster's information at top right and PC's information at bottom left.
* Shows wild (monster's name) appeared! (Pretty much like Pokemon red...)
* Player can choose fight the monster or run away.
* When running away, if PC's rank is lower than monster's rank, PC will be hit by the monster once.
* If PC choose to fight, he can still run away in the fighting process.
* It's pretty much a Pokemon like combat mode.
* Important: When entering 2 or 3 in the combat mode, you need to enter them twice to make it work.(bug when jumping over the information)

* Rank and EXP:
* Monsters' hp and damage are depending on base hp, damage and their ranks(Higher rank, higher hp and damage).
* PC will gain EXP after kills a monster(higher rank of the monster, higher EXP).
* PC will rank up when EXP gets to an enough point(100 * current_rank^2).
* When PC rank up, renew his hp, damage and speed(becoming higher).

* Other:
* There is a choice: using skills in combat mode. The skills part is not done yet, so it will just work as a normal attack.
* When the monster's speed is too much faster than PC,
  there is a situation that after PC run away once,
  the monster will catch him again and a new combat will start.
